# django-diary
Creating a diary web application using Django

## Purpose
I created this small project with the intent of testing out my Django skills after finishing a Web Development Udemy course. Using this project I am hoping to see how much HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Django I know.


## Description
Just a small web application that allows a user to view, create, and delete diary entries. It also provides a timestamp of when each entry was created.
